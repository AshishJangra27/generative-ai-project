The latest news
Last week’s
I/O keynote
was packed with live demos, model news … and plenty of numbers reflecting the momentum and growth of our products. Since there was so much going on, we wanted to try a fresh way to explore and understand some of these updates — so we asked Gemini for some help. We used
Canvas
(which also got
some updates last week
) to analyze the transcript from the keynote, pull out some impressive numbers and offer explanations of them. Then we made just a few tweaks to ensure accuracy and zhuzz it up.
To see the results, check out
this interactive web app
— just click on each tile and reveal what that number means. There’s even a post-I/O item in there we think many of you will be interested in!
